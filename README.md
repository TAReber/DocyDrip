# DocyDrip - Simple, Customizable Web Solutions
Goals of DocyDrip is to make simple reusable components, give people source code that can be easily customized to the specific requirements of their site.

[Important - Refactor incomming]
Text Editor Object is Currently in alpha build - What does this mean?
It means that this project went through about 4 refactors, some of the original code before any refactor is still in the project. Its still in there because it kept working and doing what it was supposed to do, but not necessarily ideal solution for the latest problem set.

It also means that many functions were rewritten, and because I didn't understand all the nuances of everything that was happening, I didn't revisit the places the new methods had potential to replace.

I will begin a refactor of this project, phase out much of the older code still in it.


Classes in Current Selection
TEO - Rich Text Object
TEO is a single class that creates objects that Creates the buttons, the events and manages how the structure is built inside the DOM Tree 
Disclaimer - Alpha release still has a few areas I haven't decided the best way to address, I'm still considering way to make it more user friendly and easier for people to customize. I might refactor some of the names.
